Tic Tac Toe players will compete with the C++ algorithm. Hangman players can choose to play in the easy, medium, or hard mode.
All graphics in the game are made with simple ASCII characters rather than the graphics.h library. Sounds and other features of 
the UI are produced with functions from the windows.h library. 

User credentials, players' scores, and game data are stored in .txt files. The .txt files can be protected with a password in 
personal systems to prevent data tampering.
